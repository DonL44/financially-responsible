## Progressive Web Applications (PWA): Budget Tracker

### Description

*Giving users a fast and easy way to track their money is important, but allowing them to access that information at any time is even more important. Having offline functionality is paramount to the success of an application that handles users’ financial information*

### User Story

AS AN avid traveler
I WANT to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection
